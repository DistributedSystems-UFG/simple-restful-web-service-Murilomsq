# RESTful-WS-Example
Simple RESTful Web Service used to illustrate the concept (based on the example by S. Subramanian on DZone.com).
Starter code for the assignment described below.

What you have to do on this assignment:

After experimenting with this Web service (as described in the lab), extend the service (and its API) to:

a) store and update the salary of the employee;

b) check for errors, such as when trying to update information for a employee that does not exist;

c) retrieve the average salary, considering all the employees;

d) update the README with documentation of the service´s API (all its endpoints and how to use them).
